This is my full code for the inventory application. 
The code has CRUD functionality, with the additional function of the ability to create warehouses/locations and assign inventory to specific locations. 
Specifically, after assigning an item to a warehouse location, the user can view which items belong to a specific location in the form of a list. 
I programmed this application using the concept of linked lists and pointers.
